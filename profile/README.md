Traffix is a traffic monitoring project based on Video Detection System. 

We utilize AI real-time object detectors, offering cutting-edge performance in terms of accuracy and speed. Which can generate a rich array of data available and a non-intrusive installation.

Our initial Executive Summary as follows. Traffic congestion can lead to economic loss and psychological effects such as road rage. According to Bappenas's research, annually Rp 65 T are lost by traffic congestion at Jabodetabek,  furthermore, economic losses could potentially reach up to Rp. 100 T. With that in mind, any potency of economic loss should be reduced to maximise countries' economic efficiency. Many stakeholders, including government officials and the public, should be aware and informed of such a condition to pressure and influence many entities to work towards a solution. However, the current ATCS (Area Traffic Control System) statistic only offers limited data and short-term information on traffic conditions, there is a lack of clarity to explain and address why traffic congestion happens. To solve that, we offer solutions to compile an insightful traffic data analysis from ATCS CCTV data to inform policy-makers and the public. Since our application provides real time data about traffic, vehicle types, statistics about traffic and vehicle types, and congestion, such data is expected to help any stakeholders to get informative data.
